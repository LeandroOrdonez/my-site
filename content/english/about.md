Hi, I’m Leandro Ordóñez. I am a data engineer and scientist passionate about turning complex datasets into meaningful insights and smarter decisions. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences Engineering from [UGent’s IDLab](https://idlab.technology/), where I explored cutting-edge research in distributed data systems.

My career has taken me from academia to entrepreneurship to applied industry innovation. As co-founder of [BitBang Company](https://thebitbang.company), I helped organizations across South and Central America harness the power of Big Data and Analytics. Today I work as a Data Science Engineer at [Yazzoom](https://yazzoom.com), a Belgian scale-up in Ghent, where we build AI-driven solutions that optimize industrial processes. My focus is on developing real-time data pipelines, predictive models, and smart software that reduce energy consumption, minimize waste, and enable more sustainable operations.

## My Toolkit

I combine academic rigor with hands-on engineering to deliver scalable solutions:

- **Data Science & Engineering**: Building data pipelines and ML models with `scikit-learn`, `Spark`, `Kafka`, `Kubernetes`.
- **Software Development**: Writing clean, efficient code in `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Java`; optimizing relational and NoSQL databases.
- **Innovation & Research**: Exploring new approaches in Big Data, Web Technologies, Semantics, and Distributed Systems.

## Let’s Connect

I enjoy collaborating on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible with data, from infrastructure optimization to advanced ML solutions. If you would like to exchange ideas or explore potential collaborations, feel free to reach out:
