I'm an electronics engineer currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Sciences at [IDLab](https://idlab.technology/) - [UGent](https://www.ugent.be/). My research has been around enabling fast access to large data stored in heterogeneous and distributed data store technologies. I'm also one of the founders of the [BitBang Company](https://thebitbang.company), a company devoted to bring the perks of Big Data and Data Analysis to businesses of all sizes. The company currently operates in Colombia with clients in South and Central America.
