Hello! I'm Leandro Ord칩침ez, a data engineer and scientist with a Ph.D. in Computer Sciences Engineering from [UGent's IDLab](https://idlab.technology/). My passion lies in unlocking the potential of vast, distributed datasets, making them accessible and actionable for businesses and researchers alike.

My journey has taken me from the cutting-edge research environment of IDLab to the dynamic world of tech entrepreneurship. As co-founder of [BitBang Company](https://thebitbang.company), I've had the privilege of helping businesses across South and Central America harness the transformative power of Big Data and Analytics.

Since April 2022, I've been applying my expertise as a Data Science Engineer at [Yazzoom](https://yazzoom.com), a Belgian scale-up based in Ghent. At Yazzoom, we're at the forefront of leveraging advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence to revolutionize industrial processes, delivering immediate value to our customers while contributing to a more sustainable future. My work involves developing smart software solutions that process real-time sensor data and historical big data, optimizing control systems, and providing data analytics services. Through our AI-for-Industries software product Yanomaly and tailored solutions, we're helping companies across various industries reduce energy consumption, minimize raw material usage, and eliminate waste.

## My toolkit

My expertise is a fusion of academic rigor and practical application, spanning:

- **Data Science & Engineering:** Mastering tools like `scikit-learn`, `Spark`, `Kafka`, and `Kubernetes` to build robust, scalable data pipelines and ML models.
- **Software Development:** Crafting efficient solutions in `Python`, `Java`, and `JavaScript`, with a keen eye for database optimization across `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, and `MongoDB`.
- **Research & Innovation:** Pushing the boundaries in Big Data, Web Technologies, Semantics, and Distributed Systems.

## Let's connect!

I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what's possible with data. Whether you're looking to optimize your data infrastructure, implement cutting-edge ML solutions, or discuss the latest trends in data science.
