I'm a Colombian engineer currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Sciences at [IDLab](https://idlab.technology/) - [UGent](https://www.ugent.be/). My research has been around enabling fast access to large data stored in heterogeneous and distributed data store technologies. I'm also founder of the [BitBang Company](https://www.thebitbang.company) a company devoted to bring the perks of Big Data and Data Analysis to business of all sizes. The company currently operates in Colombia with clients in South and Central America.
